# opencv
## Introduction 
These are the scripts for practicing opencv using Python on PC and Mac

## How to get started 

1. On the Mac I am using virtualenv 
    1. go to terminal 
    1. if it is the first time type ```virtualenv -p python2.7 test``` 
        - ```-p python2.7``` means that I will use python2.7 this could be changed to for example 3.7
        - ```test``` is the name of the folder that you are creating with the new virvualenv
    1. ```cd test```
    1. ```source bin/activate```
        - this will start the virtual environment and you should see something like (test) at the beggining of each line in Terminal
